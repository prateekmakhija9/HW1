	<h1>Makhija, Prateek </h1>
		<p>I'm a Computer Science student at CU Boulder. I'm from Massachusetts 
		which means that I am a hardocre Patriots fan. I also love music 
		and I enjoy playing the guitar and the piano. The reason that I am studying Computer Science is because I really enjoy technology and I'm curious how everything works and how we got to the level of technology we have today. I'm also passionate in buisness and studying computer science means I can understand a different persepctive of business.
